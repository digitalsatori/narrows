# Code

* \*\*\* Urgent
* \*\* Important
* \* Think About This for the Future

# Sitewide

* \* ~Think about changing "Narrations" to "Stories."  Ex. "Active Narrations" becomes "Active Stories"~

# Home Page
* \*\*\* Create an editable, default "Cover Image" thumbnail for each story -- this shouldn't be difficult and it will make the narrative seem more "real" and "published"
* \*  Think about adding a "What's New" feed -- so that you can immediately see changes or updates to the stories you are part of.
* \* Think about showing a snippet of "teaser text" from each story.

# Narration Main Page

* \*\*\* ~Add avatar thumbnails for each character~
* \*\* ~Novels. This seems like a really cool feature, and I think I understand how it works, but it would be great to have either a tool tip or a line or two of text explaining that this is a way to view the story from each character's PoV.~
* \*\* ~Also, I noticed that when you first view the page, it says "No novel for [Character]" but then when you click on the link, it creates the novel. So it might be better to change the text to read something like "Create Novel for Mom" or "View Novel for Mom"~
* \*\* ~Status: Replace "Mark as finished" "Mark as abandoned" buttons with three radio buttons: "Active" "Finished" "Abandoned"~

# Chapter Page
* \*\*\* Upon clicking Publish, good if there is some result. E.g. Give option to view the story
* \*\* ~Under Conversation, between the text box and "Send" button, add the word "Include:" next to check boxes. Otherwise, it isn't immediately clear how the set of character check boxes in between relates to the message you are sending.~
* \* ~For Actions, think about changing "Not submitted yet." to "Nothing has happened yet."  or "None."~
* \* Ran into some weird delays when trying to add a new background image. (Error submitted via Github.)
* \* ~Not sure what "Control" means in this context: "Home ? The Case of the Missing Cake ? A Classic Whodunit ? Control"~
* \*  Not sure why option to "Publish" is hidden when you first click on Chapter page.


# Character Pages
* \*\*\* ~Make clear what information other characters will see, and what is for reference for the character only. I.e. Is there a difference between Description and Backstory?~

# Things I Really Liked

* Option to include background music.
* "Tips" for Action section.
* The new Novel feature.
* Default look and feel of the "Read/Preview" sections."
* In general, I think the implementation is ok, and the overall concept is really strong and also very original. If your server will support it, I would encourage you to open NARROWS up for testing. It's a very unique concept, and based on the conversations I have had so far, there is a lot of demand for it.


I also imagine that at some point you may encounter the problem of how to manage simultaneous, conflicting real-time text edits. I encourage you to look at the code for Cryptpad from Xwiki. I know one of the lead developers and would be happy to make an introduction if this is helpful. https://github.com/xwiki-labs/cryptpad
