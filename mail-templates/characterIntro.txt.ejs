NARROWS is an online storytelling system. Someone has created a character for you, and the first chapter of the story will (hopefully) come soon!

The story is called "<%= narrationTitle %>" and your character in the story is called <%= characterName %>. You can go to your character sheet at the address below to read the (public) description and (private) backstory of your character, and the description of the other protagonists in the story:

<%= characterSheetLink %>

Now it is only a matter of reading the character sheet and waiting until you receive the link to the first chapter via email. Have fun!
