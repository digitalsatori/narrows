NARROWS is an online storytelling system. Someone has created a character for you, and the first chapter of the story will (hopefully) come soon!

The story is called "<%= narrationTitle %>" and your character in the story is called <%= characterName %>. You can go to your character sheet at the address below to see its description and backstory:

<%= characterSheetLink %>

Now it is only a matter of reading the character sheet and waiting until you receive the link to the first chapter via email. Have fun!
