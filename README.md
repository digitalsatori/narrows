TODO
====

* Make some way to preview chapters for different characters
* Really wait until everything is loaded before showing the "Start" button

Later
-----

* Why does Opera for Android not start the music when it's on, and
  effectively inverts the audio toggle functionality??
* Refactor the reader app, maybe integrate it with the rest somehow?
* Allow narrators to change password, and create more narrators
* Maybe add an "admin" role to that not all narrators can create users?
* Show background information or whatever to players
* Add some place for players to write notes

Initial narrator
----------------

The initial user/narrator is "narrator", and the password is "changeme!".
